Open two instances of Unity using ParrelSync (https://github.com/VeriorPies/ParrelSync).
Load the 'GameScene' for both instances and start the game.
In one of the two instances press the '2' key to change the player index to 1.
In both instances press the '5' key to start the GGPO connection and you're good to go.
